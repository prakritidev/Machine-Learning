# Machine-Learning
This repository contains the documented example codes of Scikit-Learn, This repository will be useful for Machine Learning staters who find difficult to understand the example codes. 

This repo also provides the workflow to the self-starters how to getting started with ML and provides which topic you should complete first. 

I'm using codes that are available on Scikit-Learn

Pre-Processsing   :- Preproceeing step is important because in real world you will always collect dirty data. 
                     You have to make it ready so that it can be used for further process.
                  
Feature Selection :- Next step is Feature Selection, In this step we select those attributes(Features) that are most relevant to your                        predictive modeling problem. 

Feature Selection is not Dimension Reduction.
